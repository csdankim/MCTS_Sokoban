# Aritificial Intelligence Project
## Iterative Deepening A*, Recursive Best First Search, and Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Sokoban Games  
&nbsp;

### Abstract

As the final project, we implemented IDA*, RBFS and MCTS in order to solve Sokoban game
which is the well-known single player game. Sokoban game is a big challenge in artificial
intelligence study due to its problem complexity. So, we had to apply heuristic functions and
deadlock detectors. All algorithms solved problems, but their performances are, of course,
different. The result of this experiment shows the possibility to improve algorithms further by
considering specific conditions of the environment of the game.
